# Contributing

As this is time critical project, contributors are advised on working the unfinished parts, and create better flexible ui elements.

At this time we don't have requirements written up so we need you to identify gaps and propose features/fixes.

1. Identify features/bugs and create a GitHub issue (whether you're a developer or not). Put as much info as you can in the ticket. Enough detail/context so new comers can jump in and pick up the ticket
2. Run this past the project leads or ask for some input on the slack channel
3. If you can, work on the issue and create a pull request for it
